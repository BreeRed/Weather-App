# Weather-App

This Weather App is a simple application that allows users to check the current weather conditions of any location. It was built primarily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the integration of APIs to retrieve weather data. Users can input any location, and the app provides real-time weather information such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
